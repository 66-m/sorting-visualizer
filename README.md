This Program Visualizes and Audiolizes Sorting Algorithms. It includes 18 different Sorting Algorithms which can be visualized with 16 differnt Visuals, including two 3D models.
It comes with a user friendly settings menu, letting the user customize what the program should do and how it should look.

## Downloading and running the Visualizer
You can download the latest version of my Visualizer [here](inset link to release)
* Option 1: Just download the [executable](insert link to exe) and run it
* Option 2: Download via git and build the code [on your own](https://github.com/CompilerStuck/sorting-visualizer#how-to-build-the-code-for-yourself):

        git clone https://github.com/CompilerStuck/sorting-visualizer.git
        cd sorting-visualizer
