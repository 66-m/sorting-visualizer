This Program Visualizes and Audiolizes Sorting Algorithms. It includes 18 different Sorting Algorithms which can be visualized with 16 differnt Visuals, including two 3D models.
It comes with a user friendly settings menu, letting the user customize what the program should do and how it should look.
